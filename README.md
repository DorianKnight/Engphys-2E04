# Engphys-2E04
Built a finite state machine from JK-flip flops, 'and', 'or', 'not' and 'nand' gates to display my student number on repeat.
- Simulated using NI Multisim and built physically using breadboards, jumper wires, seven-segment display and seven-segment decoder.
- Performed Karnaugh mapping for SOP and POS configurations.
- Optimized stateflow through state reduction and reusing gates where possible
